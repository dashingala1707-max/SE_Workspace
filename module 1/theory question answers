1. Explain in your own words what a program is and how it functions.
A program is a set of instructions written in a programming language that tells a computer what to do. It functions by taking input, processing it according to the instructions, and producing an output.

2. What are the key steps involved in the programming process?
Problem analysis – Understand the problem.
Algorithm design – Plan the solution step by step.
Coding – Write the program in a programming language.
Compilation/Execution – Convert code to machine-readable form and run it.
Testing & Debugging – Find and fix errors.
Maintenance – Update the program as needed.

3. What are the main differences between high-level and low-level programming languages?
high-leval :this is the programming lenguage which is easyly understend by the human being.
low-leval:this is the programming language which is not understend by any human and the computer can easyly understend it.

4. Describe the roles of the client and server in web communication.
Client: Sends requests to access resources or services..
Server: Receives requests, processes them, and sends back responses.

5. Explain the function of the TCP/IP model and its layers.
The TCP/IP model allows computers to communicate over the internet. Its layers:
Application Layer – Handles network services like HTTP, FTP.
Transport Layer – Provides data transfer (TCP/UDP).
Internet Layer – Routes data packets (IP).
Network Access Layer – Handles physical transmission of data.

6. Explain Client Server Communication.
Client-server communication is a request-response model:
The client requests data or service.

The server processes the request and sends back a response.
This allows multiple clients to access centralized resources efficiently.

7. How does broadband differ from fiber-optic internet?
Broadband: General term for high-speed internet over cable, DSL, or wireless; slower than fiber.
Fiber-optic: Uses light signals through fiber cables; faster, more stable, and supports higher bandwidth.

8. What are the differences between HTTP and HTTPS protocols?
HTTP:this protocol is used when any website is not safe for ypu and your data.
HTTPS:this protocols is used when any website is fully secure with you and your data.

9. What is the role of encryption in securing applications?
Encryption converts data into a coded format that only authorized users can read. It protects sensitive information from hackers, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and security of applications.

10. What is the role of application software in businesses?
Application software helps businesses automate tasks, improve efficiency, manage data, and increase productivity.

11. What are the main stages of the software development process?
Requirement analysis, design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance.

12. Why is the requirement analysis phase critical in software development?
It clearly defines user needs and prevents errors, rework, and project failure.

13. What is the role of software analysis in the development process?
It studies requirements and converts them into a clear and workable solution plan.

14. What are the key elements of system design?
Architecture, components, data design, interfaces, and security.

15. Why is software testing important?
It finds errors, ensures quality, and verifies that software works correctly.

16. What types of software maintenance are there?
Corrective, adaptive, perfective, and preventive maintenance.

17. What are the key differences between web and desktop applications?
Web apps run in browsers and need internet; desktop apps are installed and can work offline.

18. What are the advantages of using web applications over desktop applications?
Easy access, no installation, automatic updates, and platform independence.

19. What is the difference between system software and application software?
System software controls and manages computer hardware and provides a platform for applications (e.g., Operating System).
Application software is designed to perform specific user tasks like writing documents or browsing the internet.

20. What is the significance of modularity in software architecture?
Modularity divides software into small, independent modules. It makes the system easier to understand, develop, test, maintain, and modify without affecting the entire system.

21. Why are layers important in software architecture?
Layers separate responsibilities within software. They improve organization, make maintenance easier, enhance security, and allow changes in one layer without affecting others.

22. Explain the importance of a development environment in software production.
A development environment provides tools like editors, compilers, and debuggers. It helps developers write, test, and debug code efficiently before deploying it to production.

23. What is the difference between source code and machine code?
Source code is written by humans using programming languages and is easy to read.
Machine code is written in binary form (0s and 1s) and is directly executed by the computer.

24. Why is version control important in software development?
Version control tracks changes in code, helps multiple developers work together, allows recovery of previous versions, and prevents data loss.

25. What are the benefits of using GitHub for students?
GitHub helps students learn version control, collaborate on projects, showcase their work, access open-source projects, and improve coding skills.

26. What is the significance of DFDs in system analysis?
DFDs show how data flows within a system and help in understanding system processes clearly.

27. What are the pros and cons of desktop applications compared to web applications?
Pros: Fast performance, works offline, better hardware access.
Cons: Requires installation, less portable, manual upda
